After that you are ready to work with database and networking so..   

### DataBase in android:
in android world.. the database commes from different sources (Local & Remote).   

**Local:**

Before we start with sqllite.. what is the DataBase generally => [simple tutorial](https://youtu.be/FR4QIeZaPeM)
